#MAKEAMERICAGREATAGAIN!

I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?

@HillaryClinton was gonna beat Obama. She was favored to win, and she got schlonged, she lost, I mean she lost.

I know where @HillaryClinton went, it’s disgusting, I don’t want to talk about it. Don’t say it, it’s too disgusting.

There were people that were cheering on the other side of New Jersey. They were cheering as the World Trade Center came down.

I’m calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S. until our country can figure out what is going on.

Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? She’s a woman, and I’m not s'posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on.

You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever. #GOPDebate

I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists.

@SenJohnMcCain is not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.

Now, the poor guy — you've got to see this guy, ‘Ah, I don't know what I said! I don't remember!

When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let’s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time.

Free trade is terrible. Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people. But we have stupid people. 

I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.

We need a leader that wrote ‘The Art of the Deal’. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

I have a great relationship with the blacks.

These are stupid people that say, Oh didn't Trump declare bankruptcy? Didn't he go bankrupt?' I didn't go bankrupt.

I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful.

If @HillaryClinton can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America.

You know, it really doesn’t matter what they write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.

All of the women on 'The Apprentice' flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.

I've said if @IvankaTrump weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.

The beauty of me is that I'm very rich.

Every time somebody said I made a mistake, they do the polls and my numbers go up, so I guess I haven't made any mistakes.

We're gonna have businesses that used to be in New Hampshire come back, and you can tell them to go fuck themselves. Because they left!

We're going to knock the shit out of ISIS. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

These people – I'd like to use really foul language. I won't do it. I was going to say they're really full of shit, but I won't say that.

When it comes time to default, they’re not going to remember any of the Republicans’ names.

In life you have to rely on the past, and that's called history.

I am a traditionalist. I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.

Let me tell you, I'm a really smart guy.

I’ll tell you, it's Big Business. If there is one word to describe Atlantic City, it's Big Business. Or two words – Big Business.

The man that wrote the second book didn't write the first book. The difference was like chicken salad and chicken shit.

I will build you one of the great ballrooms of the world.

I don't like the crying. Reminds me of @JebBush.

I don't get along with rich people. I get along with the middle class and the poor people better than I get along with the rich people.

She really has become a monster. I mean monster in the most positive way.

My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well been documented, are various other parts of my body.

I'm not a schmuck. Even if the world goes to hell in a handbasket, I won't lose a penny.

If @POTUS resigns from office NOW, I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!

My I.Q. is one of the highest, and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.

@JebBush You’re a moron Jeb(!). You’re an embarrassment to yourself and your family. America needs a real leader.

@HackIllinois Let me tell you all, when I become president I’m going to #MakeChampaignGreatAgain. You can count on that.

We love out vets and they’re being treated terribly.

Our police are terrific. We love our police. They are not being treated properly.

I love China!

I don’t think the pope really understood the crime problems and the problems of illegal immigration.

To think that Apple won’t allow us to get into her cell phone - who do they think they are? 

I’m the strongest person on the stage for the Second Amendment.

How @HillaryClinton gets away with the email stuff is hard to believe.

The police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order.

I’d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. 

We have all donors in the audience and the reason they’re not loving me is I don’t want their money.

The war in Iraq - I was the one who said “Don’t go, don’t do it”. So I’m not the one with the trigger.
