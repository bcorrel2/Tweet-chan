***Conception***

Tweet-chan was concieved and programmed at the 2016 HackIllinois Hackathon. The goal of Tweet-chan was to develop a powerful script with real world implictions using simple python code . 

***Tweet-chan***

Tweet-chan works in 2 steps:

Step 1: Upon activation, Tweet-chan will take a simple text file and scan it for invalid tweets. If an invalid tweet is found, the user is notified and the program finishes. 

Step 2: Tweet-chan will activate a cycle that will loop indefintely. The cycle begins with with Tweet-chan choosing a random tweet and posting it. Tweet-chan will then look for new followers. Tweet-chan will follow any user who follows it. The cycle ends with Tweet-chan putting itself to sleep. After this period is over, the function recurses and the cycle begins anew. 

***About text.txt***

Thanks to built-in tweet-detection, Tweet-chan is able to take many types of text file. To create a text file for Tweet-chan, input a tweet that does not exceede 140 characters. Each tweet added should be seperated by a blank line. Reference trumpchan.txt to see how the text file should be formatted. 
    
***About Trump-chan***

Trump-chan is a comical implementation of tweetchan.py. Utilizing firey quotes and patriotic variables, Trump-chan is top-of-the-line in automated presidental candidates. 

All quotes used by Trump-chan are real or variations of real quotes. Tweets made by Trump-chan do not neccessarily reflect those of Tweet-chan or it's developer. 

***Future of Tweet-chan***

The future of Tweet-chan is unclear. At a later date, it is my intention to add an app interface to the program. Whether the app will expand into a larger creation or remain a small pet-project remains to be seen. For now, please enjoy Tweet-chan and, by extension, Trump-chan.
